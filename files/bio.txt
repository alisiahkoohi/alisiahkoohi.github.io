Ali Siahkoohi is a Simons Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Computational
Applied Mathematics & Operations Research at Rice University, jointly hosted by
Dr. Maarten V. de Hoop and Dr. Richard G. Baraniuk. He received his Ph.D. in
Computational Science and Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology in
2022. His research lies at the intersection of computational science and
artificial intelligence, focusing on developing scalable methods for quantifying
uncertainty in AI models. His expertise includes deep learning, generative models, and
uncertainty quantification, with applications in large-scale inverse problems
and other areas of computational science. Throughout his academic journey, Ali
Siahkoohi has authored 39 peer-reviewed articles published in prestigious venues
such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, and Geophysics. He has further contributed to the
scientific community as a guest editor for the Journal of Mathematics, an
associate editor for Acta Geophysica, a program chair for the AAAI Conference on
Artificial Intelligence, and a reviewer for several prestigious journals and
conferences in the fields of computational science and artificial intelligence.
Ali Siahkoohi is also the recipient of the Future Faculty Fellows award from
Rice University's George R. Brown School of Engineering.
